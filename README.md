# PlatziBootstrapBasic

The project goal of the project is to do a landing page for a Platzi event, it was mainly done with bootstrap and some JS. There are some folders for other tests I did during the development to get used to Bootstrap.

# See the project yourself

The page is responsive and you can play with it here: https://chrisvimu.github.io/PlatziBootstrapBasic/#
